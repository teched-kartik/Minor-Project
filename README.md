# Minor-Project
This repository contains work done till now for college minor project.  

## Objectives:-  
1) To develop a system to convert the speech part of the audio to text and the
background sound part of the audio to visual form((in the form of GIFs) and
show the combined output.
2) To develop an algorithm to segregate foreground sound and background
sound from the input audio.
3) Develop a model to recognise the type of background sound.
4) Develop a model to recognize and convert the foreground speech to text.
5) Develop an algorithm to combine outputs received from the two models and
show the combined output in visual form using GIFs.
